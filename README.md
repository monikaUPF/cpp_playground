## cpp_playground

Here's a collection of simple programmes that I have done while refreshing my C++ coding skills.

To run the scripts you should first compile the .cpp file

g++ filename.cpp
  
and run the executable via terminal

./a.out

I have implemented an alternative version of the rock paper scissors in Python, which is available in this Collab link https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14Nw9dZEcTfmSlF3Bqbqd0Ww4-SiVgQ9C?usp=sharing
