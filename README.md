## cpp_playground

Here's a collection of simple programmes that I have done while refreshing my C++ coding skills.

* To run the scripts in the simple_games folder you should first compile the .cpp file

g++ filename.cpp
  
and run the executable via terminal

./a.out

* To compile the script in the ufo_game folder you need to run

g++ ufo.cpp ufp_fnts.cpp

and then run the executable

./a.out
